Global Digital Strike without Analytics

This is the version snapshot from 2019 Sept 17th. 

From the site and with the analytics removed.

There is a folder with the WP Plugin 
Notice when you install the plugin update the location of the ./static/js/widget.js location 
to a place where you uploaded it in your own host. 

There is also the static option so you just look at how the index.html is done 
and adapt the code your needs. 
Basically, for a static page all you need is to updload the files to your host
and add the part between before the end of the head in static pages: 
```
    <!-- DIGITAL KLIMA STRIKE START-->
    <!-- DIGITAL KLIMA STRIKE ENDS-->```
that is between those lines. See index.html file as example.
